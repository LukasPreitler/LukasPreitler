### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub. You don't see that much on my account because I finished my software engineering and now maybe I have time to start my own project.
I finished this small power BI-Project about predicting the energy consumption of our household (https://app.powerbi.com/links/nYu8AcZn_r?ctid=61efdcdb-c49e-4010-954f-ae5b1b473ab0&pbi_source=linkShare).

Until I can add new projects, might be you are interested in my academic work, please look at my these repo (https://github.com/LukasPreitler/mytheses). 

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to for a Data Scientist, Data Analyst or Business Analyst job, Therefore
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning power BI and want to start next with azure.
